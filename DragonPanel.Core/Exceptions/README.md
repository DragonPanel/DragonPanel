# Exceptions are bad
Yeah, Exceptions for control flow are bad and painfully slow but
- They're supported by the language
- They're easy to use
- I don't have to think what the heck Monad is, I just want to write my code man

Discriminated Unions and Result type will eventually come to C#, until that happens I will use exceptions :)

In this directory exists general purpouse exeptions.
